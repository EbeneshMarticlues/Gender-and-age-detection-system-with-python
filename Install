Install the required libraries: You will need to install OpenCV and other libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. You can install them using pip.

Collect the dataset: You will need a dataset of images that includes the gender and age labels of the people in the images. You can use publicly available datasets like the UTKFace dataset.

Preprocessing: The images need to be preprocessed to be fed into the machine learning model. You can perform operations like image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

Train the model: You can use machine learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to train the model on the dataset.

Testing: After training the model, you can test it on new images to detect the gender and age of the people in the images.
